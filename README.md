Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player think of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.

In this project, I will be applying what I'd learnt so far on File I/O & Serialization:

- Reading data from a text file which contains a dictionary of words
- Writing data to save game
- Reading data to load game

Created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum
